# üîí TLS Setup on Kali Linux with Apache

This project demonstrates how to set up a secure HTTPS server using a self-signed TLS certificate on Kali Linux, using Apache2. It is part of my cybersecurity portfolio to showcase hands-on knowledge of configuring web servers securely.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Environment

- **OS**: Kali Linux (Debian-based)
- **Web Server**: Apache 2.4+
- **TLS/SSL**: OpenSSL (self-signed certificate)
- **Browser**: Firefox/Chromium for testing `https://localhost`
